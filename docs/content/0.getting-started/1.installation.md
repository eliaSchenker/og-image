## Setup Module

Want to know why you might need this module? Check out the [introduction](/docs/og-image/getting-started/introduction).

To get started with Nuxt OG Image, you need to install the dependency and add it to your Nuxt config.

## Verifying Installation

Out-of-the-box the module will not do anything until you configure it.

You can verify the module is installed correctly by checking the [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) for the OG Image tab.

The DevTools is the starting point, providing a playground to design and test your OG Image with full HMR support.

## Configuration

OG Images must be served with absolute URLs, if you're prerendering, you will need
to provide a Site URL.
